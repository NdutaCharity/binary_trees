# Binary Trees

## Learning objectives
   1. What is a binary tree
   2. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
   3. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
   4. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
   5. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
   6. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
   
## Important terms with respect to tree.

  * Path − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.
  * Root − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.
  * Parent − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.
  * Child − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.
  * Leaf − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.
  * Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.
  * Visiting − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.
  * Traversing − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.
  * Levels − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.
  * keys − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.

## The basic operations that can be performed on a binary search tree data structure, are the following −

  * Insert − Inserts an element in a tree/create a tree.
  * Search − Searches an element in a tree.
  * Preorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.
  * Inorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.
  * Postorder Traversal − Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.
